# Mowi Bot 
Hello! This is Mowi Bot, a Discord bot coded with the [JDA (Java Discord API)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)! Currently I only have a few ~~meme~~ fun commands for my friends, but I am working towards becoming more useful.

[![Discord Invite](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/462444808221491210/463630243643523082/fruitcake.png)](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=462441653420949519&scope=bot&permissions=2146958591)

## Documentation
* `&help` - displays available commands, GitHub link, and invite link

Fun commands:
* `&ping` - returns "pong"
* `&translate` - alters a phrase's 'r' and 'l' to 'w'
* `&say` - repeats after you!
* `&MOWI` - sends a :HYPERS:
* `&avatar` - displays your own avatar (`&avatar @user` for another user's avatar)
* `&<BnS Emote Name>` - displays emote (e.g. shy, tears, giggle, grrr)

## Goals/To-Do's
* PRIORITY: Join voice channels
  * Music bot functions ([LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/LavaPlayer))
* Rich presence (e.g. "say &help")
* Deletes response if user deletes command (e.g. a deleted &say command)
* 'Pats', 'Hugs', 'Slaps' upon mentioning a user

## About
I am a beginner in Java programming, currently learning the syntax and trying to interpret classes, objects, etc. My programming background only includes introductory C programming. Thus, any advice or constructive criticism is very much appreciated!

As well, after hours and hours I just cannot figure out how to push my files with Git Bash (yet). So for now I will just be manually uploading them... I guess...T_T
